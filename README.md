# SPT-Dijkstra-and-ECMP
Try to implement Shortest Path Routing with Dijkistra Algorithm and ECMP.
## -cnstln36.txt
This file is a topology file , use this topology to implement Dijkstra and ECMP.  
And in this implement , all cost set as one.

## -Priority_queue.c 
This is a file implement Priority Queue with Minimun Heap.  
This file be include by Dijkstra.c and ECMP.c and ECMP_Link_Disjoint.c to achieve Priority Queue.
## -Dijkstra.c
This file you can key in the source and Destination Node Number,  
Then you can get one Shortest Path and Distance.
## -ECMP.c
This file you can key in the source and Destination Node Number,  
Then you can get all Equal cost Shortest Path and Distance.
## -ECMP_Link_Disjoint.c
This is a prototype now to find the Link Disjoint path on ECMP.
